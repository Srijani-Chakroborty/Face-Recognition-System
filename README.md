# Face-Recognition-System

<a href="https://github.com/Srijani-Chakroborty/Face-Recognition-System/blob/master/LICENSE"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-red.svg" alt="license"/></a>

A simple system application for face extraction and recognition using machine learning concepts and python libraries. This system application is very easy to use and also easy to understand whether a face is recognized or not. We have used green and red frames to let users understand that green box is for 'face is succesfully recognized' and red box is for 'face is not recognized', and also if the face is covered or not visible then it will show that 'face is not detected'.

# Why use it?
For normal system face verification this simple system application will be very easy to use

# Features
* Less complex code.
* Very simple and easy to use.
* Face recognition file for training the images and tester file for testing the image or recognize the image on the screen.
* If the image is recognized then it will be unlocked with a green box else it will be locked with a red box.
* If the face is not detected then it will show that face is not found.

# Built With
* Php
* Haarcascade Classifier file
